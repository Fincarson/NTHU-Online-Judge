# Problem 13337 - Karpet Sierpinski

## Description
[NTHUOJ Problem 13337 - Karpet Sierpinski](https://acm.cs.nthu.edu.tw/problem/13337/)
This can be solved with recursion.

The Sierpinski Carpet is a self-similar pattern with 8 non-overlapping copies of itself. 

It starts with a white square divided into 9 smaller subsquares, which interior square is filled with black (Depth = 1).

To obtain a carpet at Depth = 2, do the same procedure recursively to the remaining 8 subsquares.
